A sleek, modern, and feature-rich Todo application built with React, TypeScript, and powered by Preact/Signals for efficient state management. The entire application is styled with pure CSS, featuring a dark theme, custom form elements, and smooth transitions.

## ✨ Features

*   **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, read, update, and delete your todos with ease.
*   **Reactive State Management**: Uses `@preact/signals-react` for a fast and intuitive state management experience.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Todos are automatically saved to the browser's Local Storage, so you never lose your tasks.
*   **Inline Editing**: Double-click or use the edit button to update a todo's content directly in the list.
*   **Task Filtering**: Dynamically filter tasks by "All", "In Progress", or "Completed" status.
*   **Modern Dark UI**: A visually appealing dark theme designed to be easy on the eyes.
*   **Custom Styling**: Includes custom-styled checkboxes, select dropdowns, and scrollbars for a cohesive look and feel.
*   **Remaining Task Count**: A live counter shows how many tasks are yet to be completed.
*   **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript for a robust and error-free development experience.
